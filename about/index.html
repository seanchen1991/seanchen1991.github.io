    <p>I&rsquo;m a teacher at heart, currently of computer science and problem solving. I studied Applied Math at university, then went through Hack Reactor&rsquo;s sixteenth cohort as a means to transition into web and software development.</p>
<p>My interests have since shifted towards systems programming, data structures, operating systems, programming languages, and things of that nature. I love fiddling with the elemental components upon which software and programming are built upon.</p>
<p>My current programming language infatuation is <a href="rust">Rust</a>, though I also really enjoy branching out and learning about different programming languages and what makes them tick. <a href="haskell">Haskell</a> and <a href="idris">Idris</a> anyone?</p>
<p>Some projects I&rsquo;ve been involved with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="exercism">exercism.io</a> is a platform that brings together students who are seeking to level up their skills in particular programming languages, and mentors who are experienced in those programming languages, giving both parties a streamlined way to provide feedback to one another. I&rsquo;m helping to work on their Rust curriculum.</li>
<li><a href="pijama">Pijama</a> is a functional programming language currently in very early stages of development. It&rsquo;s not intended to become a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; programming language, but it&rsquo;s real enough to grant me a front-row seat into seeing how real programming languages are created.</li>
</ul>
